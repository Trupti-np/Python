Create one variable containing following type of data:
(i) string
    a="hello"
    type(a)
    output:str
(ii) list
     b = [ '12.3' , 'ML', '3' ]
     type(b)
     output:list
(iii) float
      c=3.14
      type(c)
      output:float
(iv) tuple
      d=(4,2.3,'ML')
       type(c)
      output:tuple
Given are some following variables containing data:
(i) var1 = ‘ ‘
    string
(ii) var2 = ‘[ DS , ML , Python]’
     string 
(iii) var3 = [ ‘DS’ , ’ML’ , ‘Python’ ]
      list
(iv) var4 = 1.
      float
 Explain the use of the following operators using an example:
(i) / : It is used to perform division operation
c=2/6
print(c)
output:0.33
(ii) % : It is used to perform division operation and prints remainder
d=3%6
print(d)
output:3
(iii) //: Its is floor operator it basicaly round-off and prints whole number as here answer is 5.33 it round-off to 5
16//3
output:5
(iv) **:It is used as power operator
2**3
output:8

Create a list of length 10 of your choice containing multiple types of data. Using for loop print the
element and its data type.

b=[1.0,23.4,3.14,"hi","hello","welcome",True,False,9,3+4j]
for j in b:
    print(j,type(j))

output:
1.0 <class 'float'>
23.4 <class 'float'>
3.14 <class 'float'>
hi <class 'str'>
hello <class 'str'>
welcome <class 'str'>
True <class 'bool'>
False <class 'bool'>
9 <class 'int'>
(3+4j) <class 'complex'>

Using a while loop, verify if the number A is purely divisible by number B and if so then how many
times it can be divisible.
 
a=int(input("Enter value of a"))
b=int(input("Enter value of b"))
while a%b==0:
   print("divisible","a is divisible by b for", a/b,"times")
   break
        
else:
   print("not divisible")
   output:         
 Enter value of a 21
Enter value of b 3
divisible a is divisible by b for 7.0 times
         

  Create a list containing 25 int type data. Using for loop and if-else condition print if the element is
divisible by 3 or not.
l=[3,6,9,1,4,30,15,17,16,12,19,20,21,24,27,29,60,25,10,40]
for j in l:
    if j%3==0:
        print(j,"its divisible by 3")
    else:
        print(j,"its not divisible by 3")
    
output:
  3 its divisible by 3
6 its divisible by 3
9 its divisible by 3
1 its not divisible by 3
4 its not divisible by 3
30 its divisible by 3
15 its divisible by 3
17 its not divisible by 3
16 its not divisible by 3
12 its divisible by 3
19 its not divisible by 3
20 its not divisible by 3
21 its divisible by 3
24 its divisible by 3
27 its divisible by 3
29 its not divisible by 3
60 its divisible by 3
25 its not divisible by 3
10 its not divisible by 3
40 its not divisible by 3  

Q7. What do you understand about mutable and immutable data types? Give examples for both showing
this property.
